   <h2>Summary</h2>
   <p>I am energetic, goal-oriented, communicative with long-term
    experience in sales and team work, training new employees and
    solving problem situations. I want to connect my future with
    personnel management. My goal is to work in a job where I can
    organize my work independently, be in a cohesive team and
    realize myself also as a training manager or a recruitment
    specialist, because it is an interesting and dynamic job and I see
    myself in it. I am looking for a job where there are opportunities
    to work remotely or in hybrid mode.</p>
